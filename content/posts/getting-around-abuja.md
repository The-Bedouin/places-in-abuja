**Last Updated: November 3, 2025 | By Bello Hassan, Local Guide & Abuja Expert**

Welcome to your complete guide for navigating Abuja. The first thing you'll notice here is the roads—wide, sweeping, and smooth. Abuja is a modern, purpose-built capital, which means it's almost entirely car-centric. This isn't a city you can easily explore on foot.

Because of this, knowing how to move from Maitama to Jabi, or from your hotel to a restaurant, is the absolute key to unlocking the city. More importantly, knowing what you should pay and how to travel safely is paramount.

As a long-time resident, I've used every option available, and I've built this guide to give you the confidence to navigate like a local from the moment you arrive.

We're not just going to list apps; we're giving you the on-the-ground, practical intelligence you need. This is your definitive, trustworthy resource for all things transport in Abuja.

In this guide, we will cover:

- **Ride-Sharing Apps**: The modern standard using Bolt & Uber.
- **Airport Transport**: The best ways to get from Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport to your destination.
- **Local "Green Cabs"**: The art of using local taxis and mastering negotiation.

Let's get you moving.

## About the Author

Bello Hassan is a senior writer for Places in Abuja and a 15-year resident of the city. After moving from Lagos in 2010, he has worked as a consultant, helping new expatriates and their families get settled in the FCT. He has an in-depth, on-the-ground knowledge of the city's neighborhoods, transport, and local economy. His insights are based on years of first-hand experience.

## The Standard: Using Bolt & Uber in Abuja

In modern Abuja, ride-sharing apps are not just an option; they are the standard. As a local guide, I can tell you that Bolt and Uber are the dominant, most recommended methods for navigating the city, and it's what I use almost daily.

The reason for this dominance is twofold: safety and fixed pricing. Unlike hailing a cab on the street, these apps log your entire journey, track your driver in real-time, and show your route. This level of accountability provides enormous peace of mind for both residents and new visitors.

Crucially, the price is calculated and fixed by the app before you even book the ride. This completely removes the stress and uncertainty of haggling, which is a non-negotiable part of using local taxis.

In my experience, the service is generally reliable, especially in central districts like Wuse 2, Maitama, Jabi, and Garki, where a car is rarely more than five minutes away. However, you must be prepared for the payment system.

**A Resident's Tip**: Always have cash. While the apps allow you to add a debit or credit card, Abuja's economy runs on cash. Drivers strongly prefer it, and you will often encounter "network issues" or drivers who ask you to pay cash instead of with the card on file. To avoid any hassle, I always recommend selecting "cash" as your payment method from the start.

Even with the convenience, you must be safety-conscious. Before every ride, verify the car's license plate and model match what's in the app.

Take a second to confirm the driver's face matches their profile picture. Once your trip starts, use the in-app safety features, like "Share Your Trip," to send your live location to a friend or colleague.

## From the Tarmac: Navigating Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport

Your first experience in Abuja will be navigating the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (ABV), and as a local guide, I want to make this process as stress-free as possible for you.

Your journey from the airport to the city center (like Wuse 2 or Maitama) will take about 30 to 45 minutes, depending on traffic, so choosing the right transport is key.

Once you exit the arrivals hall, you'll be met with two primary choices: app-based ride-sharing or the official airport taxis.

My strong recommendation for a first-time visitor is to use a ride-sharing app like Bolt or Uber. The major advantage here is fixed pricing. You will see the exact fare to your hotel before you even get in the car, removing all guesswork.

Simply follow the signs to the designated ride-sharing pickup area (usually a short walk from the exit), and use the app as you normally would. It's the most seamless and reassuring option after a long flight.

Your other option is the fleet of official, licensed airport taxis. These are readily available right at the curb. The main difference? You must negotiate your fare before you get in.

The drivers are professionals, but you will need to have a clear destination and be prepared to haggle for a fair price. If your phone is dead or you prefer not to use an app, this is a solid, safe alternative—just be confident in your negotiation.

**A Resident's Tip**: As you exit, you may be approached by many unofficial drivers. I strongly advise politely declining and heading either to the official airport taxi rank or the designated ride-sharing pickup zone. Stick to the official channels for your safety and peace of mind.

## The Local Way: How to Use Abuja's 'Green Cabs'

Before Bolt and Uber dominated the streets, the undisputed king of Abuja transport was—and still is—the iconic "Green Cab." You'll see these official city taxis, painted in their distinct green and white, everywhere.

As a local guide, I can tell you that learning to use them is a key local skill, especially for times when your phone battery dies or the network is bad.

Here is the most critical piece of advice I can give you: Green Cabs do not have meters. The price is not fixed. You must negotiate and agree on a fare with the driver before you open the car door.

This is a non-negotiable step. If you get in without agreeing on a price, you will almost certainly be overcharged at the end of your trip.

So, when would you use one? They're perfect when your phone is dead, when you're in an area with poor data coverage, or when you're just making a quick, short hop (a "short drop") down the road.

Negotiating is a simple, quick process, and it's a normal part of the city's culture, so be confident!

### How to Negotiate with a Green Cab

1. **State Your Destination**: Confidently hail a cab and tell the driver your exact destination (e.g., "Jabi Lake Mall").
2. **Get the Price**: The driver will give you their price. This is just an opening offer.
3. **Give Your Counter-Offer**: Have a fair price in your head and give your counter-offer.
4. **Agree and Confirm**: After a brief, friendly haggle, you will agree on a fare. Confirm it one last time (e.g., "Okay, 2000 Naira to Jabi?") before getting in.

**A Resident's Tip**: The easiest way to learn the fair price for a route is to quickly check it on a ride-sharing app like Bolt first. If the app says the trip is 1500 Naira, you know that's your baseline for negotiating. It gives you all the power.

## Frequently Asked Questions (About Abuja Transport)

### What is the average taxi fare from Abuja airport to Maitama?

As a local, I can tell you that a ride-sharing app like Bolt or Uber will typically cost between N5,000 and N7,000 from the airport (ABV) to Maitama or Wuse 2, depending on demand and time of day. If you are negotiating with an airport taxi, this is a good baseline to have in mind.

### Is Bolt or Uber better in Abuja?

Both are widely used and reliable in the central areas. In my experience, Bolt often has slightly lower prices and more available drivers. However, I recommend having both apps on your phone to compare prices and availability in real-time.

### Is it safe to use taxis in Abuja at night?

Generally, yes, but you must be smart. I strongly recommend using a ride-sharing app (Bolt/Uber) at night instead of hailing a street cab. The app provides a digital record of your trip, the driver's details, and a live-tracking feature you can share, which is a crucial safety layer.

### Do you have to tip taxi drivers in Abuja?

No, tipping is not required or expected for taxi or ride-sharing drivers in Abuja. The agreed-upon price (either via the app or through negotiation) is the final price.

## Conclusion

As you can see, navigating Abuja is straightforward once you know the rules. It boils down to a simple choice: use ride-sharing apps like Bolt and Uber for convenience and price security, or master the art of negotiating with the local "Green Cabs" for the full resident experience.
