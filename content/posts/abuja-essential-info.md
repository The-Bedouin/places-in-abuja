## About the Author

Bello Hassan is a senior writer for Places in Abuja and a 15-year resident of the city. After moving from Lagos in 2010, he has worked as a consultant, helping new expatriates and their families get settled in the FCT. His insights are based on years of first-hand experience navigating life in Nigeria's capital.

## The Reality of Safety in Abuja: An On-the-Ground Guide

Let's address the most important question first: Is Abuja safe? As a 15-year resident who has raised a family here, my honest, on-the-ground answer is yes, but with a critical caveat: you must be smart, vigilant, and aware.

The media narrative you read abroad often paints a stark picture that doesn't fully capture the daily reality for those of us living in the city's main districts. Life in central areas like Maitama, Wuse 2, Asokoro, and Jabi is generally calm and secure. People go to work, shop at the markets, and meet at restaurants every day without incident.

The feeling on the ground is one of reasonable safety, not constant fear.

However, that sense of calm is built on a foundation of practical, common-sense precautions. This is not a city where you walk around complacently. "Situational awareness" is the most important skill a resident has.

We are vigilant. We keep our car doors locked at all times, even during the day. We are mindful of who is around us when we park or get out of our cars. We secure our homes, and most residents live in compounds or estates with private security.

We also generally avoid unnecessary travel to unfamiliar areas after dark. These aren't acts of panic; they are just the normal, sensible routines of urban life in a major capital.

**A Resident's Tip**: The best advice I give to newcomers is to be "smart, not scared." Use trusted ride-sharing apps at night instead of hailing cabs. Be aware of your surroundings at ATMs. Don't be flashy. The vast majority of people here are just living their lives, and if you follow these simple, local habits, you will too.

We've broken down the practical, common-sense steps every resident takes. For a detailed analysis of safety by neighborhood, see our [Is Abuja Safe? A 2025 Safety Guide for Residents & Visitors](/blog/is-abuja-safe).

## Navigating Healthcare: A Guide to Hospitals in Abuja

One of the biggest anxieties for anyone moving to a new city is healthcare. "What happens if I get sick? What if my child needs a doctor?"

As a 15-year resident and a parent in Abuja, I want to offer you some critical reassurance: the standard of private healthcare in this city is high, and it is what most new residents and the expatriate community rely on.

Abuja's healthcare system is essentially two-tiered. While there are large, public government-run facilities (like the National Hospital), the experience for most professionals and families is centered entirely on the private sector. This is where you will find a network of modern, well-equipped, and patient-focused facilities.

I've watched the private sector grow immensely over the last decade. We are not just talking about small clinics. Abuja is home to large-scale, modern private hospitals that offer comprehensive services, from 24/7 emergency care to specialized surgeries.

You can be confident in the availability of highly-trained specialist doctors, modern diagnostic equipment, and a high standard of care that meets international expectations.

To give you an idea of the standard, institutions like Nizamiye Hospital are known for their modern facilities and wide range of specialists, while Nisa Premier Hospital has a long-standing reputation, particularly for services like maternity care. Beyond these, you will find a strong network of excellent specialist clinics for everything from pediatrics to dentistry.

**A Resident's Tip**: My advice to all newcomers is to register with a private hospital or clinic before you need one. Do your research, visit a couple, and get your family's details on file. Having a go-to doctor and knowing where the nearest reliable emergency room is provides incredible peace of mind.

Choosing a hospital for your family is a critical decision. We've reviewed the top facilities for specialist care, emergency services, and patient experience. Check out our [Complete Guide to the Best Hospitals in Abuja](/blog/best-hospitals-abuja).

## A Parent's Guide to International Schools in Abuja

As a parent who moved to Abuja 15 years ago, I can tell you this from first-hand experience: for many relocating families, the school search is often more important and stressful than the house hunt.

The good news is that Abuja has a mature, high-quality, and diverse international school system. This is a primary reason why many expat and professional families find it a comfortable and easy place to settle.

The city's school scene is robust enough to cater to most educational backgrounds. The British curriculum is the most widely available, with many excellent schools offering the IGCSE and A-Level pathways, which are globally recognized.

You will also find highly-regarded American curriculum schools offering US-style diplomas and AP classes, as well as institutions that provide the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme.

The general standard at these top-tier schools is high, often featuring modern campuses, a wide array of after-school activities, and a strong academic focus.

But based on my experience, these schools serve another vital function: they are the social and community hubs for the expat and professional community. The parent-teacher associations, school fairs, sports days, and cultural events are often where relocating families build their first friendships and support networks.

A word of warning: the admissions process for the most sought-after schools can be highly competitive. Waiting lists are common, especially for popular grade levels, so this is not a decision to be left until the last minute.

**A Resident's Tip**: My single most important piece of advice for relocating parents is to start your research and contact school admissions offices months before your move. Do not wait until you have landed. The top schools often have rolling admissions, but popular classes fill up very quickly.

Finding the right school is as important as finding the right home. For a detailed breakdown of the top schools, their fees, and curricula, see our [Ultimate Guide to International Schools in Abuja](/blog/international-schools-abuja).

## Daily Life Essentials: Banking, Shopping & Utilities

Once you've handled your safety, health, and schooling, the final step is setting up your day-to-day life. As a resident who's done this from scratch, I can tell you it's a straightforward process.

### Banking

First, banking. This is surprisingly efficient. Abuja has all of Nigeria's major national banks, like Zenith, GTBank, and Access Bank, all of which have robust digital platforms and mobile apps.

To open an account as an expat, you will typically need your residence permit (CERPAC), proof of address (like a utility bill or tenancy agreement), and a valid ID. The process is quick, and you'll have a functional bank account, debit card, and app access, often within the same day.

### Shopping

Next, shopping. Residents here use a mix of two different worlds. For a modern, one-stop, air-conditioned experience, we go to malls. Jabi Lake Mall, for example, has a large Shoprite for groceries, as well as clothing stores, pharmacies, and restaurants.

However, for the best fresh produce, meat, and bulk items, we go to the traditional markets. Wuse Market is an institution. It's a vibrant, sprawling hub where you can find everything, but be prepared to navigate the crowds and haggle!

### Utilities

Finally, the two most critical utilities: power and internet. The public power grid is unreliable. This is a simple fact of life. Therefore, every functional home, office, and shop runs on a backup system. This is non-negotiable.

You will have a generator for heavy-duty power (like A/C) and, ideally, an inverter system, which provides silent, battery-powered electricity for lights, fans, and Wi-Fi when the grid is down.

For the internet, while fiber optic is available in some new estates, the primary source of connection for most residents is high-speed mobile data from providers like MTN and Airtel.

**A Resident's Tip**: My number one life hack for new residents: get a portable 4G/5G MiFi (mobile hotspot) and buy SIM cards from two different networks (e.g., MTN and Airtel). When one network is slow or down, the other is almost always working. This is the secret to staying connected and sane!

## Frequently Asked Questions (for Residents & Visitors)

### What is the emergency number in Abuja?

The national emergency number in Nigeria is 112. This number is free to call from any mobile network and can be used to request help from the Police, Fire Service, or Ambulance services.

### Is it safe to walk at night in Abuja?

As a local, my strong advice is no, you should not walk at night. While main districts are secure, they are not designed for pedestrian traffic after dark. For all nighttime movement, I and other residents exclusively use cars or trusted ride-sharing apps like Bolt and Uber.

### What do I need to open a bank account as an expat?

As mentioned, you will typically need:
1. A valid ID (your passport).
2. Your residence permit (CERPAC).
3. A recent utility bill or tenancy agreement as proof of address.
4. Two passport photographs.

Having these ready will make the process very fast.

### Is the internet in Abuja good?

The internet in Abuja is generally reliable, but it's different from what you might be used to. The most common solution is high-speed 4G/5G mobile data from providers like MTN or Airtel, which is fast enough for streaming and video calls. Fiber optic "to the home" is available but less common and mostly found in new estates.

## Conclusion

As you can see, settling into Abuja is a smooth and manageable process when you have the right, practical information. Knowing the on-the-ground realities of safety, having confidence in the healthcare system, and understanding the practicalities of daily life are the keys to a successful move.
